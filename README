# Introduction
The project comes from [here](https://ftp.ast.cam.ac.uk/pub/hg/), which used for opacity interpolation and was written in F77. I rewrite some codes to help the project support F95 and canbe compiled with gfortran.

The instructions file is transfered to pdf from ps format by me, which stored in `doc/notes.pdf`.
## Origin Info
This is version v9. (20/08/97)

Documentation can be found in the doc subdir:
 
       ./doc/notes.ps    ...... Postscript file
       ./doc/notes.dvi   ...... dvi file (device independent)
