-------    ----------
v6a        use linear interpolation for partial derivatives.

v6b        use analytical formular for partial derivatives.
           Known bugs: eps to small -> can lead to 'division by zero'

v7         birational splines option, selectable with new argument
           variable imode > 0 .
           use analytical formular for y-partial derivatives (T).
           drelpr -> 10.d0*eps to prevent bug 'division by zero' as in v6b.

v8         inclusion of OPAL95
           use analytical formular for part.derivatives

v8z        25/05/97: a) interpolate logarithmical in Z
                     b) use min(|Z_tab-Z_val|) for table selection
                         &  min(|X_tab-X_val|)

v9         20/08/97: - use Akima's scheme for OPAL95 table extrapolation
                       (before Shepard's method was used)
                     - inclusion of Itoh's electron conduction (ApJ 273,774)
                     - added low-T tables of Alexander & Ferguson (1995)
                     - rearrangement of dir-structure (only one library 
                       necessary yet for the link process)
